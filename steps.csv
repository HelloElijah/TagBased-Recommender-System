Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll into an 11 1/2-inch circle. Transfer the dough to the prepared pie plate, gently pressing it into the bottom and sides. No fluted crust is necessary. At this point, set the crust in the freezer for about 10 to 15 minutes to get it really chilled, which will make for a flakier crust."
449,123,6,"Remove the chilled crust from the freezer and pour the filling to about 1/4 of an inch below the top of the crust, as it will puff up slightly when baking. Bake for 1 hour or until the filling puffs up, turns golden, and is ""set,"" meaning it should be firm, not jiggly when you gently move the pie plate. Remove from the oven and let cool on a rack.

459,124,9,Bring dough to room temperature in the morning and divide in half. Form each half into a ball and place each dough ball into a 5 1/4″ x 3 3/4″ paper panettone mold or metal coffee can (my photos were taken when I mixed up a double batch of these lovely cakes.)
460,124,10,Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Take the 1 egg and the 2-3 tbsps of cocoa powder and beat well until fully combined and no lumps appear.
461,124,11,Brush this glaze mixture liberally over the top of each molded dough and then sprinkle heavily with the turbinado or pearl sugar to cover the tops.
462,124,12,Bake until golden brown in the center of the oven for about 50 minutes or so. Remove from oven and let cool.
463,124,13,"Once the cakes are cooled, sprinkle the top of one cake with powdered sugar (if desired) or store for future use in well-sealed plastic bags. These cakes freeze well for future use (within a month or so of baking.)"
464,124,14,I like to store them as is and then when ready to serve cut them into slices and sprinkle powdered sugar over the sides and tops of the slices. Truly wonderful with espresso and cordials after dinner or for a sweet treat at breakfast.
465,125,1,"Coat a very large skillet (about 14 inches in diameter) with a lid with the olive oil. On medium heat, warm the oil and add the sliced sausage. After the sausage begins to render some of its fat, raise the heat and add the chicken. Sauté until the sausage and chicken just begin to brown a bit."
466,125,2,"Stir the onion, celery, bell pepper, garlic, paprika, thyme, basil, oregano, and cayenne (if using) into the sausage and chicken and sauté over medium heat until the vegetables soften.

467,125,3,"Add one cup of the water, bring up to a low boil, and stir in the pasta."
468,125,4,"The pasta should take about 12 minutes to cook, so at the 7-minute mark, add the shrimp and continue to simmer until the pasta is al dente and the shrimp is just cooked through. If you need to loosen the dish up a bit, add that extra 1/2 cup of water during the last few minutes."
469,125,5,"Serve in bowls, and garnish with the green onion."
470,126,1,"Put together in a bowl the sugar and the yolk eggs and  beat them. Add bit by bit the flour and then add the melted butter and   the powder. Now add the milk. Grate just a bit of lemon peel. The mixture should be quite creamy.
A part cut the apples, remove the peel and get some slices. 
Butter and flour in the pan and put into the mixture. Add the slice of apples pushing them into the batter."
471,126,2,"Bake it for 30 minutes - 140°
Let cold and dust the cake with sugar."
472,127,1,"Preheat the oven to 400. Peel and dice the butternut squash. Place the squash on a sheet pan, then drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with coarse salt (a good pinch or two).  Toss to combine, then make sure all the pieces are flat on the pan, not on top of each other. Bake until the squash is tender and browned, stirring occasionally, 20-25 minutes."
473,127,2,"Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add salt (I add 1 tablespoon), then add the pasta and cook until al dente. Drain, reserving ½ cup of the pasta waster."
474,127,3,"While the pasta is cooking, crumble the goat cheese in the bottom of large bowl. Melt the butter over medium heat, and then stir in the garlic and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the vermouth and cook until slightly reduced, about 2 minutes. Turn off the heat, and add the basil and thyme."
475,127,4,"Add the pasta to the goat cheese, and using tongs or serving spoons, toss until the goat cheese is evenly coating the pasta (pour a little of the reserved water on top if you need to loosen the cheese). Pour the butter-herb mixture on top, and toss until combined. Add the roasted butternut squash and caramelized onions, and toss gently until combined; season with salt and pepper to taste, and top with toasted pecans, if desired."
476,128,1,Cook the orzo in abundantly salted water according to package instructions or to your taste. Drain and transfer to a large salad bowl.
477,128,2,"Meanwhile, make lemon-dill vinaigrette to dress the salad: combine lemon zest and juice, mustard, and grated shallot in a medium bowl. Whisk everything together with a few pinches of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Slowly add the olive oil while whisking, then stir in the chopped dill. Taste and adjust as needed."

488,130,8,"when wine is nearly evaporated, reduce heat, add tomatoes and cook for 10 minutes or so"
489,130,9,"add capers (i prefer just to shake the salt off them rather than wash them), parsley and olives. again stir carefully: you don't want to turn this into fish puree. when the tomato juice is released and the sauce is just thickening, turn off heat. you want the tomatoes a little raw."
490,130,10,cook pasta al dente.
491,130,11,carefully add the sauce to the pasta over a little heat. stir gently for a minute or two and serve.
492,131,1,"MAKE THE BREAD DOUGH: In a bowl, combine the water, fresh yeast and sugar, stirring/mixing till the yeast is dissolved. Combine the flours with the salt then using a dough whisk or a wooden spoon, gently add the bread-salt mix to the yeasty water, stirring till the flour is all used up. Carefully shape the dough into a ball and place in bowl. Gently oil the top of the dough and cover lightly, or with greased clingfilm (oiled side down). Allow dough rise for a couple of hours, then gently turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Alternatively, place dough in the fridge and use later. If using after refrigeration, allow dough rest out of the fridge for 10 - 20 minutes before use"
493,131,2,"MIX THE FILLING: In a bowl, combine the provolone, pecorino, ham, bacon, boiled eggs, olives and crushed dried chillies and oregano."
494,131,3,"MAKE CASATIELLO NAPOLETANO:Oil a large bundt pan/angel food tin with some olive oil. Then lightly flour  a  surface and roll out the dough into a rectangle 1/2 cm thick.  Place the filling in the centre of the rectangle, lengthways and sprinkle some black pepper over to the top."
495,131,4,"You will need to roll the dough into a sausage or cigar so pull one side in over the top, holding both ends of the dough  and bringing in. Then grab the centre of the other side (and not the ends) and bring over the top to seal (and form a crown). Pinch the ends to seal and bring them together to form a coil."
496,131,5,"Gently lift dough and place in greased bundt pan. If you don't have one, place on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Leave to rise at room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour, or until risen."
497,131,6,"While the dough is resting, preheat the oven to 230° C. 
Brush the casatiello with olive oil and bake it for 10 minutes  at 230 °C, then lower the temperature to 200 °C and cook for another 30-40 minutes. The casatiello should be cooked through and golden, though testing it will be toguh as the melted cheesy centre won't give the dry response you seek."
498,131,7,"Remove from the oven and allow to cool down for about 10 minutes in the pan. Then remove and let cool on a rack. When cold, tuck in and enjoy some soft, warm melted cheese. If like me, midnight saw this fresh out of the oven with work the following day, allow it to rest overnight in a paper (not plastic) bag, or wrapped with paper."
499,131,8,"On the day, pack your basket. Place the bread in an oven on 180°C and let warm through. Then grab some pesto or chimichurri...if you wish, maybe jars of green salad, wine glasses and a bottle of prosecco with flowers in your hair."
500,132,1,"In a small, heavy-bottomed pot (I used a 1.5 quart Staub) set over medium-low heat (I used my simmer burner and had it on medium), put the cheeses and let cook until melted, lowering the temp if things in the pot get too active. You want it at a steady melt."
501,132,2,"Meanwhile, toast the bread and when they’re crispy and warm, put the prosciutto strips on each of two bread slices.
On the other bread slices, spoon the melted cheese. Press the two sides of each sandwich together and enjoy immediately!"
502,133,1,Heat the oven to 350 °F. Position an oven rack in the center of oven.
503,133,2,"Place the butter, and sugar in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted wtih the paddle attachment (a handheld mixer is fine; just allow a little extra time to reach each stage in the recipe). Beat on medium speed until the mixture is very light in color, about 3 to 4 minutes. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the almond extract and blend well, another 30 seconds."
504,133,3,"In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture and combine on a low speed just until the dough is thoroughly combined, about 30 to 40 seconds. Measure out 1/2 cup of the dough and set it on a small plate, then place the plate in the freezer (this will chill the dough and make it easier to crumble)."
505,133,4,"Press the remaining dough into a 9 or 9 1/2-inch tart pan in an even layer (the edges can be a little higher than the rest, just be careful that the center is not the thickest point). If the dough is too sticky, just chill it briefly."
506,133,5,"Use a small offset spatula or the back of a spoon to spread the jam in a thin, even layer over the surface of the dough, leaving a border of about 1-inch around the edges."
507,133,6,"Remove the reserved dough from the freezer and crumble it into small pieces over the layer of the jam, allowing some of the jam to peek through. Sprinkle the sliced almonds evenly over the top of the tart."
508,133,7,"Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the topping is a beautiful golden brown. Remove from the oven and place on a rack to cool completely. If your tart pan has a removable bottom, to unmold, center the tart pan on top of a large can so that it balances midair as the rim of the tart pan falls to the counter. Leave the bottom of the pan under the tart for support, or run a large spatula between the crust and the pan, using the spatula to guide the tart onto a plate. Alternately, cut wedges straight from the pan. Serve with tart whipped cream."
509,133,8,"Store the tart covered in plastic wrap, at room temperature for 3 to 4 days. The tart can be assembled ahead and frozen for up to 1 month. Assemble the tart, then wrap tightly twice in plastic wrap and freeze on a flat surface -- it may require a few minutes extra of baking time."
510,134,1,"Put a pot of water over high heat on the stovetop for pasta. When water come to boil, add a handful of salt and cook pasta for about 8 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and save pasta water."
511,134,2,"Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees. Place salmon fillet on lined baking tray and season well with sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper. Drizzle lightly with olive oil. Bake for approximately 25 minutes or until salmon flakes easily with fork."
512,134,3,"In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium and add shallots, stirring occasionally, until translucent. Add garlic and anchovies and continue to stir. Season with black pepper, crushed red pepper, and, if desired, salt."
513,134,4,"When shallots and garlic are soft and lightly caramelized, add drained, cooked pasta to the skillet and toss with shallot mixture until well combined. Deglaze with wine and reduce for several minutes."
514,134,5,"Remove salmon from oven and flake into large pieces. Place in skillet and stir gently. If needed, add pasta water and check seasoning. Zest lemon over the pasta and serve."
515,135,1,"Heat the butter in a large frying pan over medium until foaming. Add the leeks and stir to coat. Sprinkle with a little dash of salt, then turn the heat to very low and cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until they’re all wonderfully brown and caramelized. If needed, add a little water at any point if they are looking too dry."
516,135,2,"In the meantime, bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil. Add in your pasta and cook until al dente. Reserve a bit of the cooking liquid, then drain your pasta."
517,135,3,"Add the leeks and grated parmesan to the pasta. Then, pour your wine into the pan that you cooked the leeks in, turn up the heat to medium-high, and cook for a couple of minutes, scraping the browned bits from the bottom of the pan into the liquid. Pour this over the pasta and leeks and toss everything together, adding a little pasta water to moisten, as needed. Cover lightly and set aside as you prepare the scallops."
518,135,4,Pat the scallops dry and sprinkle them with salt and fresh ground pepper. Heat the oil in a sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add the scallops and sear on each side until they are brown and crisped on the outside and just opaque in the middle -- this only takes 2 minutes or so per side.
519,135,5,"Divide the pasta with leeks between two plates, then perch half of the scallops on top of each. Sprinkle the lemon zest and some freshly ground pepper over each dish. Finally garnish with the parsley and cheese, and serve. And don't forget to serve the rest of the bottle of white wine."
520,136,1,"Combine the two flours in a bowl and gradually add the water, mixing until well incorporated. Work the dough for a few minutes. It should be smooth and compact, but not dry or crumbly and it shouldn't stick to your hands. If it's dry, add a little more water until it becomes smooth. Rest the dough for at least 30 minutes."
521,136,2,"Roll the dough out with a rolling pin to a thickness of 2-3 millimetres (1/10 of an inch). With a sharp knife, cut the dough into large strips about 7-8cm (2.5-3 inches) wide then cut these into short pasta strips about ¼ inch thick."
522,136,3,"Prepare the vegetables – if using savoy cabbage, slice out any tough stalks then chop into small pieces. If using silverbeet, cut out the central stalk and chop the leaves. Peel and chop the potatoes into small cubes."
523,136,4,"Boil a large pot of water, add a few pinches of salt and begin boiling the potatoes. After a couple of minutes, add the greens. After five minutes, add the pasta and let cook a further 10 minutes."
524,136,5,"Meanwhile, in a separate pan, melt the butter with the clove of garlic, sliced, until both the butter and the garlic are golden. Set aside until the pasta is ready."
525,136,6,"Remove the pizzoccheri and vegetables from the pot with a slotted spoon and place on a large, warmed platter. Scatter a handful of cheese over the top, drain more pizzoccheri and scatter again with cheese; repeat until you have removed all the vegetables and pizzoccheri from the pot and the cheese is uniformly distributed through and on top of the dish. Finally, pour over the frothy, browned butter. Serve as is -- don't mix it! -- with plenty of freshly ground black pepper."
526,137,1,"In a large mixing bowl combine the yeast with the warm water and let the mixture rest for about 5 minutes.  Stir in the egg, oregano, basil, olive oil and salt."
527,137,2,Start by slowly stirring 2 cups of the flour to the liquid mixture and then add more as needed to form a soft yet somewhat sticky dough.  Cover and let rest for about 20 minutes.
528,137,3,"After the 20 minute rest, turn the dough out into an oiled 9x13 inch baking pan. Since the dough is sticky use wet hands to press it into the pan evenly. Let this rest while you make the topping."
529,137,4,Drain the oil from the anchovies into a large saute pan and add the tablespoon of olive oil. On medium heat  add the onions and start to saute.
530,137,5,"Once the onions barely begin to soften, mince the anchovies and add them to the pan.  Continue to saute until the onions just barely start to caramelize and the anchovies ""disappear"".  Stir in the chopped olives and let the mixture cool."
531,137,6,"Once cooled, spread the onion, anchovy and olive mixture over the bread dough and let rise another 30 minutes or so."
532,137,7,Pre heat your oven to 400F and bake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes until lightly browned.  Remove from the oven and let rest in the pan for about 10 minutes.  Use 2 spatulas to lift from the pan and let the bread cool to room temperature.  Cut into small pieces to serve.
533,138,1,"Bring your broth or stock to a boil in a large saucepan, add the peas, and cook for 3 minutes. Add the pasta. (If using fresh, it only takes about 3 minutes to cook; dried takes longer, about 8 minutes approximately.) NOTE: If using dried pasta, it takes much longer to cook, and you don't want to overcook the peas. Dried pasta, depending on the type, can take 8-10 minutes, so add the peas in the last 5 minutes of cooking."
534,138,2,"Beat the egg and add the grated cheese to the egg; combine. Remove pot from the heat and pour the egg in slowly, stirring as you add. Add salt and pepper if you like; I like to add a pinch of lemon zest also. Serve with more cheese grated on top."
535,139,1,"In a wide, shallow bowl, whisk eggs, milk, crushed red pepper, and salt."
536,139,2,"Place flour in a separate wide, shallow bowl. Do the same with the breadcrumbs."
537,139,3,"In a large skillet over medium heat, add 3 tablespoons olive oil."
538,139,4,"Dip one chicken cutlet at a time in the flour, then in the egg mixture, allowing excess to drip into the bowl. Dredge in the bread crumbs, ensuring that the entire cutlet is evenly coated. Add to the skillet, and cook 3-4 minutes on each side until golden brown and crisp. Place on a paper-towel lined dish. Repeat with remaining cutlets."
539,139,5,Bring a large saucepan of salted water to a boil. Boil broccoli rabe for 2 minutes; drain and plunge into a bowl of ice water. “Shocking” the rabe will maintain its vivid green color.
540,139,6,"In a large skillet over medium heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and garlic. Sauté until garlic starts to turn golden. Add broccoli rabe, crushed red pepper, and salt. Sauté 1-2 minutes more until just tender."
541,139,7,"Place one split roll on a clean work surface. Place chicken cutlet on the bottom half of the roll. Top with ¼ of the broccoli rabe and 2 slices of cheese. Place under a broiler for 1-2 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Serve immediately."
542,140,1,Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
543,140,2,"Meanwhile, in a large sauté pan, warm the oil over medium heat. Add the garlic and anchovy and cook for 1 minute, until the garlic starts to lightly color. Add the leek and mushrooms, and cook (stirring a few times) until they start to soften, about 4 to 6 minutes. Add the asparagus, tossing well to combine. Cook for another minute, then add the Sauvignon Blanc. Let simmer until the asparagus is crisp-tender; the wine should reduce but not cook off. Add salt and freshly ground pepper to taste. Turn off heat, and stir in butter and lemon zest. Toss until the butter melts and evenly coats the vegetables. Cover and set aside."
544,140,3,"Mix together the ricotta, chopped tarragon, and mint in a small bowl. Add 1 tablespoon of lemon juice to loosen."
545,140,4,"When water is at a full boil, cook pasta until it's al dente, reserving about 1 cup of pasta water. Drain the remaining water."
546,140,5,"Return the sauté pan to medium-low heat. Add pasta to vegetables, tossing well. Add parmesan and toss again, then add half of the remaining lemon juice. Taste, and add more lemon juice, salt, and pepper as needed. (I like lots of black pepper in this dish, but add to your liking.) Add reserved cooking water, a little at a time, if the pasta seems dry."
547,140,6,"At the table, top each plate of pasta with a big dollop of herbed ricotta."
548,141,1,"Rinse beans, soak overnight and drain. To a very large stock pot add about 3 tablespoons olive oil and briefly sauté the celery, garlic, carrot, onion and ham bone or ham hocks. Break up the canned tomatoes and add to pot with all of the juices from the can. Let it all heat up while you add beans, water (optional broths if using), herbs and bay leaf. Season with a little red pepper flakes, salt and pepper to taste."
549,141,2,Simmer until beans are tender about 2-3 hours on a medium low to low simmer. Remove bay leaf. Remove bones and pick meat off to add back into the soup. Season to your taste.
550,141,3,"Cook and drain tubetti, return to cooking pot, add some of the soup broth to the pasta. At this point you can take half of the beans and puree, but I like the thinner broth and whole beans. First night soup is my favorite; everyone else likes the soup thicker or the next day."
551,141,4,"Notes for basic pasta fagioli: Once you have your basic soup ready you can get pretty creative adding in sautéed favorite greens to the simmering soup for several minutes before serving. Tiny meat balls, crispy pancetta, or prosciutto, and sausage are favorite additions for a second soup meal. Keep in mind all additions = more expense. I love freshly grated cheese in my bowl of pasta fagioli. Freeze leftover soup without pasta."
552,141,5,"Since it was sausage making day, I left some meat on the pork butt bones and added them to the soup as well, nice bits of tender pork in the soup along with the ham bits."
553,142,1,"Cook the soaked beans in water for 40 to 50 minutes until tender, reserving one cup of the cooking liquid.  Set aside."
554,142,2,"In a large soup pot saute the leeks, crushed red pepper and garlic in the olive oil until soft."
555,142,3,Slice the baked Italian sausage in 1/2 inch rounds and add to the pot. Saute for about 3 minutes.
556,142,4,"Add the chicken broth, the reserved bean broth and the potatoes. Bring to a boil and then simmer for 15 to 20 minutes."
557,142,5,"Add the greens and the cooked beans, bring back to the boil and simmer until the greens have wilted."
558,142,6,Season to taste with salt and pepper.
559,143,1,Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
560,143,2,Place a 12 inch saute pan over high heat.  Add the pasta to the boiling water pot and cook it according to the directions on the box.  About 10 minutes.
561,143,3,Add the butter to the saute pan.  Add the shallot and zucchini.  The zucchini should just start to caramelize.  Season with salt and pepper.
562,143,4,Add the chicken and a 1/4 cup of the pasta water.
563,143,5,"When the pasta is finished cooking, drain it and put it back in the pasta pot.  Add the cottage cheese, cilantro and the zucchini mix.  Toss, taste and season if necessary."
564,143,6,"Put it in a big serving bowl and top it with the green coriander, black pepper,  and more cilantro.  Serve immediately with crusty bread."
565,144,1,"Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat and add the onions. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook, stirring frequently and seasoning with salt to taste as you go, until the onions are soft and golden brown, 20 to 30 minutes."
566,144,2,"Meanwhile, fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. As the water heats, add enough salt so that you can taste it. Add the pasta and cook until soft, not al dente. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water. Combine the yogurt with 1/4 cup cooking water and mix well. Add more of the reserved pasta water as needed to get the sauce to your thickness. Drain the pasta and toss with the yogurt mixture."
567,144,3,"Serve the pasta immediately, sprinkled generously with cheese and topped with caramelized onions and their juices."
568,144,4,"Note: If not using thick, Greek yogurt, line a colander with cheesecloth and set over a bowl or in the sink. Add the yogurt and let drain for 2 hours before proceeding with step 1. For a treat, seek out sheep's milk yogurt for this."
569,145,1,"In a large bowl mix together all the dry ingredients, blend well and set aside. In your mixer bowl, add the butter and sugar and cream together until well blended."
570,145,2,"Add the eggs, one at a time and blend well. Add the vanilla, lemon juice and zest of one lemon and continue to mix. Slowly add in the flour mixture, blend as you go until all the flour has been incorporated."
571,145,3,Set the dough aside and prepare the baking trays by lining them with parchment paper. Drop spoonfuls of the dough onto the baking sheet allowing some space between the biscotti.
572,145,4,"Place the first tray in a preheated 350 degree fahrenheit oven for about 10 to 11 1/2 minutes (or until the bottoms start to turn light golden brown, the tops will still look light.)"
573,145,5,Do not over bake these as the texture changes dramatically and they will be dry and tough versus soft and tender.
574,145,6,"Remove the tray and set on a rack to cool; continue baking the biscotti until all the dough is used. Once the cookies have cooled, in a large mixing bowl combine all the ingredients for the glaze except for the candy decorations."
575,145,7,Mix well with fork until smooth and creamy (add more sugar or milk depending on the thickness or thinness of the glaze.) The glaze should drip easily off the fork but retain a thickness to stay on top of the biscotti and drip down a bit.
576,145,8,Glaze them using the fork and quickly decorate with the colored nonpareils as you go.
577,145,9,I decorate a portion in this style and keep a few aside that I love to decorate with the glaze and additional grated lemon zest on top for an extra boost of lemony flavor.
578,145,10,Allow them to sit and dry completely before moving and storing the biscotti in a table-top container or freezer container.
579,146,1,Preheat the oven to 375° F.
580,146,2,"In a large bowl, toss the croutons with 1/4 cup olive oil until evenly coated. Spread the bread on a baking sheet and bake, turning with a spatula every four or five minutes, for 15 to 18 minutes, until they are evenly golden and crisp. (Use a timer!)"
581,146,3,"Meanwhile, wash the chicories. I like to tear chicories into large, two- or three-bite pieces after removing the root end with a knife. For the frisée, trim the darkest green parts and the root, and then separate all of the leaves into the chicory mix and wash and spin together. The flavor of frisée is more delicate than the bitter chicory, and its structure will provide a little lift to the salad. Wash and spin it all, and place in a large bowl with the croutons."
582,146,4,"Now, get to preparing the olive oil for poaching. The smaller the pot you can find, the less olive oil you’ll need to use. Add enough oil so that the egg you drop in will be completely submerged."
583,146,5,"Drop in two garlic cloves and a few black peppercorns, and heat the oil over low heat to 140° F. If you don’t have a thermometer, carefully use your finger to gauge how hot the oil is, starting when it’s still at room temperature. You should be totally comfortable leaving your finger in the oil for a few moments when it’s at 140°F. If the idea of dipping your finger into a pot of oil scares the bejeesus out of you (totally  understandable), then try dropping one of the croutons in. Barely any bubbles should appear. If there is serious bubbling, the oil is too hot. Turn off the heat and wait for the temperature to drop."
584,146,6,"Before you start to fry, have a slotted spoon and a plate lined with a clean towel ready. Depending on the size of your pot, you’ll be able to cook the eggs one or two at a time. When the oil is ready, gently crack the eggs into coffee cups and slip them in. Cook for about 2 minutes, or until the whites are set, then remove from oil and place on landing pad. If they stick to the bottom of the pot, use a metal spatula to gently release them."
585,146,7,"When the eggs are done, use 1/2 cup of the oil to make a vinaigrette. Smash the remaining garlic with the side of your knife, and drop it into the oil, then add a healthy pinch of salt and 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar. Whisk to combine, and adjust with salt and more vinegar as needed, remembering that the chicories will want a healthy dose of acid to balance out their bitterness."
586,146,8,"Toss the chicories, croutons, Parmesan cheese, freshly cracked black pepper and enough warm vinaigrette to coat generously. Adjust salt and acid as needed. Then, heap generous piles of salad on 4 plates, place an egg on top of each pile, and sprinkle with sea salt and cracked black pepper. Carefully lay a slice of speck over each egg and serve immediately."
587,146,9,"Don’t feel like you have to throw out the remaining olive oil!  You can let it cool, remove the aromatics, and use it for cooking over the next few days."
588,147,1,"Dice garlic. Cut up anchovies, roughly chop tomatoes."
589,147,2,"Over medium heat, saute garlic, anchovies and two rosemary sprigs until the anchovies are melted."
590,147,3,"Add chopped tomatoes. Sautee 10 or 15 minutes, till the tomatoes are fully cooked. Salt as needed."
591,147,4,"Increase heat and add can of chick peas, with water in the can, and a few cups of boiling water or heated chicken broth. Add last sprig of rosemary. Bring to soft boil."
592,147,5,"Add pasta. The liquid should just barely cover the pasta. Reduce heat to healthy simmer and cook till one minute less than the package recommends. Add water or broth if needed. But remember, the broth should be thick, so add the least amount of liquid possible that still allows the pasta to cook."
593,147,6,"When the pasta is done -- to my taste less done than usual -- spoon into bowls. Add grated parmesan, ground pepper and a few drops of good olive oil. Perfect."
594,148,1,"Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti and cook according to the package directions for al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain."
595,148,2,"While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet under high heat. Add olive oil, onions, and green beans. Season with salt and pepper and saute for about 5-6 minutes, or until onion starts to soften."
596,148,3,"Reduce heat to medium and add garlic. Cook for an additional 5 minutes longer, stirring occasionally."
597,148,4,"In a small bowl, whisk the cream and eggs. Set aside."
598,148,5,Add the chopped bacon and the cooked pasta to the skillet.
599,148,6,"Mix well. Remove from heat and add in cream/egg mixture. Let the residual heat slowly thicken the sauce. Stir in both cheeses and season with salt and pepper, if desired."
600,148,7,Serve right away with cheesy garlic bread!
601,149,1,"Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Halve the pumpkin and scoop out the seeds. Cut the pumpkin into 8 equal wedges and arrange on two baking sheets lined with foil. Sprinkle the wedges with salt and pepper and drizzle lightly with olive oil. Bake for about an hour, until the pumpkin is caramelized and tender when pierced with a sharp knife. Remove from the oven and let cool until you can handle the pumpkin without burning yourself."
602,149,2,"In the meantime, crisp the pancetta in a medium saucepan over medium heat, about 10 minutes. Remove and drain on paper towels, discarding the fat."
603,149,3,"Turn the oven up to 500 degrees. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the pasta for exactly 5 minutes, drain and run cool water over it for about 10 seconds. Set aside in the colander."
604,149,4,"Scoop enough of the cooked pumpkin from the rind to make 2 cups. Combine this with the cream in a blender and puree just until smooth (be careful not to overblend, or you’ll whip the cream). Scoop out some more of the pumpkin (you probably won’t need the whole thing) and chop roughly to make about a cup and a half."
605,149,5,"Combine the pumpkin and cream puree with the cheeses, salt, thyme and pancetta in a large bowl and stir gently to combine. Add the pasta and the chopped pumpkin and fold together just until combined."
606,149,6,"Spread the pasta evenly in a casserole or baking dish. Bake uncovered for 7 to 10 minutes, until the top is browned and the bottom layer of pasta is just tender."

608,150,2,"Toss with tuna and its packed olive oil. Mix in arugula, olives, capers, tomatoes, and parsley."
609,150,3,"Add a squeeze of fresh lemon juice and additional olive oil, if necessary. Season with salt and pepper and enjoy!"
610,151,1,First make the dough. Sift the flour and salt on your work surface and make a well in the center. Add sugar and yeast to the water and set aside for a minute for the yeast to start working. After the liquid becomes bubbly pour it into the well and start mixing the flour into the liquid with a fork. When it becomes too hard to work with the fork flour your hands and continue mixing with your hands. Knead the dough for approximately 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.
611,151,2,"Place the dough into an oiled bowl, cover with a kitchen towel and set aside in a warm place to rise for an hour."
612,151,3,In an hour the dough will double in size. You will have to knead it once more to let all the bubbles of air out. Now the dough is ready to work with.
613,151,4,"Divide it into 4 parts and with your hands only form flat circles of your future focaccias. They can be not ideal circles, it doesn't matter, but they should be rather thin - not more than 1 cm thick."
614,151,5,"Preheat the oven to 250 C and place your focaccias into a baking tray lined with parchment paper and lightly floured. Then with your fingers press the dough down a bit so that you'll leave several ""fingerprints"" on focaccias."
615,151,6,Mix 2 tablespoons of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of cold water in a cup until emulsified. With this liquid generously brush your focaccias. After that you can either put them into the oven or add a topping and then bake.
616,151,7,"Here we chose 4 different toppings for our focaccias:
-    sea salt and black and red pepper flakes
-    slow roasted tomatoes (click here for a great recipe - http://furmanfood.blogspot.com/2012/11/perfect-slow-roasted-tomatoes.html)
-    thyme leaves
-    caramelized balsamic onions (click here for the recipe - http://furmanfood.blogspot.com/2012/11/caramelized-balsamic-onions.html)"
617,151,8,Let your focaccias rise a bit for 20-25 minutes and then put them into the oven and bake for 20 minutes until golden and crispy. After 10 minutes of baking remove from the oven and either carefully brush the breads with mixture of oil and water or if you're feeling you can make a mess in a way your toppings are arranged - simply spray the focaccias with olive oil and return them to the oven.
618,151,9,"What you get now is 4 incredibly flavourful tender breads, mild inside, crispy crust, comforting, filling and simply adorable. Get your family together and dig in!"
619,152,1,"Cook the spaghetti in salted boiling water until tender, 7 to 9 minutes. Drain and reserve."
620,152,2,"In a large sauté pan, heat the oil over medium heat. Add the leek and garlic and saut´ until tender, about 2 to 3 minutes."
621,152,3,"Add the peas and pasta, and toss to combine. Continue to toss until the mixture is heated through. Season with red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. Using a spatula or tongs, push all the pasta to one end of the pan."
622,152,4,"Crack an egg into the empty side of the pan. Season it with salt and pepper, and reduce heat to low. Cook the egg until your desired doneness. Transfer the pasta to a large bowl and finish with parmesan cheese. Top with the egg and serve."
623,153,1,"Heat the oil in a 9-to 10-quart pot.  Add the onion and garlic and sauté until the onion is translucent.  Meanwhile, peel and cube the eggplant.   Using a vegetable peeler, peel stripes in the zucchini skins.  Slice diagonally in large chunks."
624,153,2,"Add the eggplant and green and red peppers to the pot, cover and cook slowly about 1 hour."
625,153,3,"Add the tomatoes, squash and anchovies.  Simmer uncovered over medium low heat until the mixture is thick.  This may take a couple of hours.  Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste.  Add capers during the last fifteen (15) minutes of cooking.  The mixture should cook until the vegetables seem to have melted together.  Serve hot or cold."
626,153,4,"Poke the sausages with a fork on two sides, and simmer in about 2 inches of water for 10 minutes, or until cooked through.  Drain well.  Just before ready to serve, heat a grill or a heavy cast iron skillet.  Brown the sausages well on all sides."
627,153,5,"Slice the baguettes in half, then in half lengthwise.  Scoop out some of the bread on one side to make a cradle for the sausage. Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil on the bread.  Place one grilled sausage in each half of the bread.  Cover with warm ratatouille, and top with the rest of the bread.  Messy, but delicious!"
628,153,6,We like a red Pic St. Loup from the Languedoc with these sandwiches.
629,154,1,Make the preferment.  Whisk the yeast into the water and add the flour.  Stir to blend.  It will be a bit stiff.  That’s okay; it will loosen up as it proofs.  Cover tightly with plastic and let proof at room temperature until it has visibly risen and even looks a bit bubbled beneath the surface of the dough.  This will take a few hours.  Refrigerate overnight.
630,154,2,"The next day, remove the preferment from the fridge at least an hour before you plan to mix your bread dough so it can lose its chill."
631,154,3,"When ready to mix, add the water and yeast to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook.  Whisk to blend, then whisk in the honey and the warm milk (nuke it for a few seconds)."
632,154,4,"Add the preferment, bread flour, all-purpose flour, salt, and olive oil.  Mix until all ingredients are well blended and no visible streaks of flour remain, about 3-4 minutes.  Turn off the mixer and cover the bowl with a piece of plastic.  Allow dough to rest for 20 minutes.  This is called an autolyse.  It permits the protein strands to become fully hydrated without the stress of mixing at the same time.  By the time you turn the mixer back on, you’ll be amazed by how quickly the dough comes together around the hook, and you actually see long, thin strands of gluten as they leave the sides of the bowl.  After turning the mixer back on, knead for 5 minutes.  This can a difficult dough to windowpane because it is so tender, but you will be able to tease a walnut-sized piece over your fingertips to a good thinness."
633,154,5,"Turn the dough out onto a floured surface.  Pan-spray the mixing bowl and return the dough, turning it over once.  Cover the bowl with your same piece of plastic and allow to proof at room temperature until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours."
634,154,6,"Now you have some choices.  I frequently shape, proof, and bake one loaf on the same day I mix the dough.  It’s my way of having my so-to-speak cake and eating it too.  I get a gorgeous, light, crusty loaf of fresh bread to have with dinner, and the next day get 1 to 3 MORE loaves (depending on how you shape them) of even lighter, crustier, more gorgeous bread.  The overnight retarding of the dough permits yeast and bacterial action to produce a bread of great character and flavor, so it is definitely worth doing so with at least part of your dough.  So, once the dough has doubled after its first proofing, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface.  Divide off a piece of it:  a half or a quarter, depending if you want to make 2 large loaves in total, or 4 smaller baguette-sized loaves.  Re-spray the bowl and return the balance of the dough to it, and cover it with a fresh piece of plastic.  Shape the piece of dough as you wish:  into a round boule, a long thin baguette, or an oval batârd.  Set it on a baking sheet lined with parchment, or if you have an oven stone, just proof it on a sheet of parchment.  Dust the top with flour and cover lightly with your piece of plastic.  Let proof at room temperature until doubled, about an hour."
635,154,7,"When the dough is about half-proofed, set your oven to 450 degrees.  If you have a baking stone, set it in the oven at the same time.  I long ago sacrificed a small cast iron skillet to the oven.  I just leave it on the floor of the oven all the time, so that when I bake bread that needs the crisp, crackly crust, I add a cup of boiling water (very carefully, mind you) to the skillet and shoot the bread that I’ve proofed on a sheet of parchment right in onto the stone.  Give both some thought.  Together they make a significant difference in the quality of the final bread."
636,154,8,"This part goes fast:  just before you put the bread in the oven,  pour the hot water into the skillet if you have one, and carefully set it on the oven floor.  Slash the bread diagonally 3 or 4 times with a serrated knife held at an acute angle.  Get the bread into the oven.  Set a timer for 15 minutes.  Don’t open the oven until it goes off.  Then, re-set the timer for another 15 minutes, open the oven and quickly rotate the bread 180 degrees.  The bread is done when it reaches an internal temperature of between 200 to 205 degrees.  A boule will take about 5 minutes longer than a baguette shape."
637,154,9,"When done, remove from the oven and cool on a rack for about 15 minutes before slicing.  It’s worth the wait."
638,155,1,Heat oven to 325 degrees. Pulse 1/4 cup of the pine nuts  in a food processor until coarsely ground. Break the almond paste with your hands; add to the processor; process until just mixed. Add the sugar; process until mixture is crumbly. Add the egg whites and vanilla; process until the dough begins to come together. Add the flour and salt; process until fully blended and smooth.
639,155,2,"Pour the remaining pinenuts into a small bowl. Using a teaspoon and slightly moistened hands, take about 1 teaspoon of batter and roll it into a ball. Gently drop the ball in the pine nuts and turn until completely coated. Place the cookies 2 inches apart on parchment-lined baking sheets. Bake for 20 minutes, until lightly browned."
640,155,3,"Cool on racks. Dust with powdered sugar before serving, if desired. Stored in an airtight container, cookies should last for 7-10 days."

642,156,2,Strain and rinse the remaining can of beans.
643,156,3,"Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat and sauté the sausage until browned, about 5 minutes."
644,156,4,"Add onion, garlic, rosemary, thyme, basil, salt, pepper and chili flakes to the pan."
645,156,5,"Sauté about 8 minutes, until the onions are soft and golden brown, then add kale and sauté an additional 2 minutes."
646,156,6,"Add white wine and simmer until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes."
647,156,7,"Add bean and tomato purée, remaining beans, broth, parmesan rind and pasta."
648,156,8,"Simmer until pasta is tender and mixture is thick, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes (add more broth if necessary)."
649,156,9,Mix in ¼ cup cheese and adjust seasoning to taste.
650,156,10,Ladle into soup bowls and top with remaining cheese and parsley.
651,156,11,Serve with toasted bread rubbed with garlic.
652,157,1,"SAUTE THE MUSHROOMS: In a skillet, heat 3 Tbsp olive oil over MEDIUM HIGH heat.  When the oil is hot, add the sliced mushrooms and saute until golden brown, 5-6 minutes.  Season with a little salt and pepper and then set aside to cool."
653,157,2,"TOSS THE SALAD: In a large serving bowl, whisk the remaining 4 Tbsp olive oil with the lemon juice. Add a little salt and pepper and then taste. Add more oil or lemon juice as you like. Add the celery, cooled mushrooms, cheese, and parsley to the bowl and toss until combined. Season with sea salt and pepper and serve."
654,158,1,Preheat the oven to 425 degrees.
655,158,2,"Separate the dough into 4 pieces and roll into 1 inch balls. Let rest on the counter covered by a towel. Add the oil to a skillet on medium high. Once the oil is hot, add the garlic and oil. Cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Leave in the skillet to cool."
656,158,3,"Add the crumbled feta, sundried tomatoes and thyme to a large bowl. Add the oil mixture to the feta."
657,158,4,"Cook the pasta for 4 minutes, or until softened but still crisp. drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water (just in case you need more than 1/3 to 1/4 cup as the recipe calls for)."
658,158,5,"Toss the pasta with the other ingredients in the bowl. Add the pasta water, a bit at a time, and stir until a creamy texture is formed. Some of the feta chunks will remain."
659,158,6,Put the pasta in a casserole dish and tuck the dough balls into the mixture. Cover with tin foil and bake for 10 minutes. Remove the tinfoil and bake another 10-15 minutes or until the rolls are browned on top.
660,159,1,Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper.
661,159,2,"In a medium bowl, stir wine and olive oil."
662,159,3,"In a large bowl, stir sugar, flour, baking powder, and fennel seed. Stir in liquids. Stir until well blended and a dough begins to forms. Lightly work the dough with your hands until the texture is oily, smooth, and springy. If the dough is too sticky, then mix in 1 tablespoon of all-purpose flour at a time, until smooth."
663,159,4,"Using your hands, pinch off a 2-tablespoon size piece of dough. Roll the dough between lightly floured hands. Roll into a thin cigar shape that is approximately 8 inches long. Form a U shape, then criss-cross the pieces until a braid forms. Place 15 biscuits per baking sheet. Brush tops of biscuits with egg wash. Bake for 40 minutes, rotating pans mid-way through. Biscuits should have a golden color and be crisp on the bottom. Remove from oven and place on a cookie rack to cool completely."
664,159,5,"Biscuits should be stored in an air-tight tin container (preferably tin to maintain their crispness) and kept in a cool area, such as a cupboard. Properly stored, they should last up to one month."
665,160,1,"Start by washing your herbs, fruit, and veggies to remove any dirt and dust from the skins.  

Since we're using whole ingredients, skins/leaves intact, ORGANIC INGREDIENTS ARE MUCH PREFERRED.  Any toxins that can exist in the whole foods will most likely exist in the skins and leaves and can be easily transfered into your syrup...  no fun."
666,160,2,"In a medium sauce pot over low heat, combine sugar, water, and honey.  Stir to dissolve."
667,160,3,"Skin your cucumber, slice your orange into quarters, strip and lightly muddle your thyme leaves."
668,160,4,"Turn your heat up to medium and add cucumber skins, orange 1/4, and thyme leaves to the sugar water.  
Bring your mixture to a medium simmering boil and cook until the syrup goes transparent (about 2 minute).  Let the mixture cool 2 minutes."
669,160,5,"Strain the cooked syrup through a fine wire sieve to remove large solids and whole pieces then again through layered cheese cloth to filter out any remaining particulates.

This syrup can be canned via a traditional boiling method and will keep, once opened for 3 - 4 weeks in the fridge."
670,160,6,Frost your glasses in the freezer 1 hour prior to using them.
671,160,7,Fill glasses half way with ice and a few cucumber shavings.

673,160,9,ENJOY!
674,161,1,"Get your pasta started: cook in hot water as per package directions, when cooked, drain and keep warm."
675,161,2,"Prick your sausages with a fork and cook in skillet on stove or grill them. When cooked, slice."
676,161,3,"In a medium saucepan with a lid, warm olive oil and add pancetta or bacon. Cook, stirring, on medium for a minute, then add onion. Cook on medium until onion is softened, but not browned."
677,161,4,"Add red peppers and plum tomatoes. Turn heat to low and cook, covered, for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a tablespoon or two of water if it starts to become dry."
678,161,5,"Add vodka, garlic (reserving ½ tsp for shrimp), and red pepper flakes. Turn heat to medium, cook for a minute or two, stirring."
679,161,6,"Cover, return heat to low, and cook on low for another 30 minutes or so, stirring occasionally and adding small amounts of water if needed. You want it to be somewhere between soupy and dry."
680,161,7,"Remove lid, with a fork whisk in softened butter, and season with salt & pepper to taste."
681,161,8,"Don’t cook the shrimp until just before you’re ready to serve. In clean skillet heat 1T butter and 1T olive oil on med high. Add shrimp, turn heat to high and cook for a minute, add garlic, cook for another minute or two, on both sides, until just cooked."
682,161,9,"To serve, toss warm cooked pasta with sauce. Place sliced sausage and shrimp on top, and garnish with oregano. If you’re not Italian, feel free to serve with cheese."
683,162,1,"First, hard boil your eggs. Put eggs in small saucepan. Add enough cold water so that eggs are thoroughly covered. Add a teaspoon salt to the pan. Turn heat to high. When water starts to boil, turn heat off pan and cover. Leave eggs for 15 minutes, then drain in colander and rinse with cold water until eggs feel cool to the touch. Carefully peel eggs and slice into small dice."
684,162,2,"While eggs are cooking, add about 1 quart cold water to medium-size pan and turn heat on burner to medium-high. Wash potatoes. If your fingerlings are tiny, cut in half; if they are larger in size, cut into quarters. Do not peel. When water has reached a lively simmer, add potatoes and 1/2 tablespoon salt to water. Turn heat down slightly so that potatoes stay at a simmer, but aren't at an angry boil. Cook potatoes for about 10-15 minutes. Test a potato with a sharp knife for doneness. You want it thoroughly tender. There is nothing worse than not-quite-cooked potatoes in potato salad! Drain potatoes in colander. Return to sauce pan and cover to keep warm."
685,162,3,"While potatoes are cooking, make the garlic and oil dressing. Peel garlic and mince into very tiny dice. Put garlic and olive oil in small heavy skillet. Turn heat on burner to low. Garlic will start to bubble in about 4-5 minutes. Give an occasional stir once in a while. You may be tempted to turn heat up, so that garlic will cook faster. Resist this impulse -- garlic burns very easily and it only takes a second or two! About two minute  after garlic starts to bubble, add crushed red pepper flakes. Give the ingredients in the pan a good stir, so that the red pepper flakes get coated with the oil. Continue to cook for another five minutes or so. Take garlic off heat when it starts to look translucent and it is giving off a lovely, heady aroma. You want it to stop cooking just before it turns brown. The best way to tell if it is done is to taste it. It should taste sweet and garlicky (not at all raw) and should be a little crunchy."
686,162,4,"Finally, it is salad assembly time! Put potatoes (hopefully, they are still warm) in serving bowl or picnic container. Add diced egg and parsley. Pour garlic and oil mixture over eggs and potatoes, making sure to get every last drop of the garlic oil and all of the little bits of garlic. It may look like too much dressing at first, but don't worry -- the potatoes will absorb it all. Add lemon juice. Using a large spoon, mix ingredients carefully, so that the potatoes and eggs don't break apart but get a nice coating of the garlic and oil. Find a fork and sample the salad. It may need a bit more salt or possibly more lemon juice. I usually don't add black pepper to this salad because of the zippiness the red pepper flakes provide."
687,162,5,"Serve immediately while the potato salad is still warm. Or pack in a picnic basket to eat at room temperature al fresco. Or stick in the fridge or in a cooler, filled with ice packs, to enjoy cold. Savor every bite!"
688,163,1,In a large saute pan heat the oil and add the garlic and crushed red pepper.  Saute for about 2 minutes and add the ground fennel seed.
689,163,2,"Add the tomato, oregano and anchovies and simmer for about 2 minutes."
690,163,3,Add the chicken broth and continue to simmer for 3 or 4 more minutes.  Adjust seasoning with salt and black pepper if desired.
691,163,4,Line the leeks in a 9 x 11 inch shallow baking dish.  Spread the fennel slices over and then pour the sauce over all.
692,163,5,Cover tightly with foil and bake at 350F for 45 minutes.
693,163,6,Raise the oven temp to 400F and bake uncovered for 15 minutes.
694,163,7,"Combine the panko and cheese, sprinkle over the casserole and bake (at 400F) another 10 minutes.  Serve warm or at room temperature."
695,164,1,Preheat oven to 375 degrees.  Place baguette rounds on parchment paper on baking sheet.
696,164,2,"Cut thin slices of cheese, and place one slice on each round. The cheese is a bit crumbly, but that's OK -  you can place some of the crumbles on the bread."
697,164,3,Top each round with a 1/2 teaspoon of fig preserve.
698,164,4,Drizzle the balsamic glaze over each bread round.
699,164,5,"Place baking pan in the oven, and bake for about 10 - 12 minutes, or until the cheese starts to melt.  Just keep an eye on it as you don't want to cheese to be too melted and the fig jam to start dripping down."
700,164,6,"Transfer rounds to a serving plate, and enjoy with your Italian wine!"
701,165,1,Cook your past till al dente in a large pot of water that is heavily salted.  Reserve a cup or two of the cooking liquid.
702,165,2,"Sweat the onions in half of the butter until translucent.  Add the tomatoes, parsley and oregano.  Add a little of the pasta water to bring everything together. Combine the sauce with the cooked pasta, season well and garnish with the cheese."
703,166,1,"Combine the bread crumbs, milk, grated garlic and grated onions in a bowl and mix to combine.  Let it sit for 5 minutes.  Combine the beef, egg, parmesan and parsley with the bread crumb mixture and mix very well. ( I used the paddle attachment on my mixer.)  Season with a half a teaspoon of salt and a few turns of fresh ground pepper.  Make a walnut sized meatball.  Place a small saute pan over medium heat.  Add some oil and saute the meatball until it is done.  Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary.  Keep in mind the garlic and onion will grow stronger as the mix sets so you are really only tasting for salt.  Place them in the fridge while you cut you veggies."
704,166,2,Roll the meatballs making them golf ball size.  I used a #20 scoop.Heat a large 14 inch non stick skillet over medium high heat.  These meatballs start out very tender but firm up as the fat is rendered.  Add a couple of glugs of olive oil and gently add the meatballs and brown them on all sides.  Remove them to a sheet tray with sides when they are finished browning.
705,166,3,Heat the oven to 375 degrees.  Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.
706,166,4,"Empty out the grease and put the pan back on the heat.  Add a glug or two of olive oil and add the prosciutto.  Once the prosciutto is crisp add the chopped onions, carrots,  and celery.  Saute until they begin to soften but don't brown.  Add the garlic."
707,166,5,"Once you smell the garlic add the wine, tomato paste and the bay leaves.  Reduce the wine to a glaze and then add the stock and rosemary sprig.  Reduce the liquid by half.  Add the milk and cream.  Let it come to a boil and then then place the pan into the oven."
708,166,6,Slide the meatballs into the oven too.  Set a timer for 16 minutes.
709,166,7,About 4 minutes before the timer goes off drop the noodles into the pot of boiling water and cook for 3 to 4 minutes.(if you are not using fresh pasta start to cook it according to the time on the box and plan to have it done at the same time as the ragu)  Remove the pasta and let it drain.  Remove the sauce and meatballs from the oven.  Remove the bay leaves and rosemary sprig from the sauce.  The sauce should not be thick but should be reduced.

857,190,2,"Add vegetable mixture and any remaining liquid to blender bowl. Add crushed mustard seeds, thyme, 2 tablespoons water, Dijon mustard, and fennel pollen to blender. Put cover on bowl and begin to blend mixture. With motor running, drizzle in remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add additional water a tablespoon at a time if mixture is too thick and isn't puréeing easily. Depending on how powerful your blender motor is, you may want to purée mixture in batches. I found that it worked well for my blender to divide the mixture into two batches. Continue blending until mixture resembles a smooth purée."
858,190,3,"Taste mustard, and add salt 1/2 teaspoon at a time until flavor is balanced. If mustard does not taste sufficiently mustardy, add additional cider vinegar a teaspoon at a time until flavor tastes right."
859,190,4,Remove mustard from blender and put in serving bowl. Cover and refrigerate while you cook peppers and sandwiches. Mustard will keep in fridge for several weeks.
860,190,5,"Chop shallots, garlic, and pancetta as finely as you can. In large mixing bowl, add the first eight ingredients (shallots through thyme) and mix well with a wooden spoon. Add 1 teaspoon salt and pork to the bowl and gently separate pork strands with your fingers. Gently mix ingredients together with your hands until the pork is coated with seasonings."
861,190,6,"Form a tablespoon-sized ball of meat with your fingers. Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat and add grapeseed oil to pan. When oil is hot, flatten ball slightly and add to pan. Cook for about 1 1/2 minutes per side or until meat has developed a golden crust. Remove mini-patty from pan and let rest for a minute or two. Taste it to judge if seasonings should be adjusted. Add a little more salt to the meat in the mixing bowl if needed. If the mini-patty doesn't taste spicy enough, add a little more crushed red pepper flakes to bowl. If the herbal flavors aren't coming through very strongly, add more rosemary, sage, and thyme to the meat in the bowl."
862,190,7,Divide the meat into six portions. Form each portion into a large ball. Place on a cookie sheet or large plate and refrigerate.
863,190,8,"Fire up the grill. If you have a charcoal grill, light the coals. If you have a gas grill, as I do, light the grill and turn up the heat to medium high. If you have some, put some mesquite wood chips in your smoker box. While grill is heating, remove stems from peppers, slice peppers in half, and remove seeds. Brush outside of pepper halves with 1 tablespoon or so of olive oil."
864,190,9,"When grill is hot (about 500 degrees), oil the grill's cooking rack. Add peppers to the rack and cover the grill. Grill peppers for about 3 to 4 minutes per side until the peppers have some nice charring. It is not necessary for the peppers to be totally blackened. Remove and put peppers in a bowl to continue steaming. Cover with a tea towel."
865,190,10,Remove pork balls from the fridge. Slightly flatten each one with your hand or a spatula until it resembles a thick hamburger patty. Grill each patty for about 4 to 5 minutes per side until the outside of the patties are nice and golden and the insides are cooked to a light pink. I usually cut one patty and take a peek inside to see if it is done. Do not overcook. Pork too well done gets tough very quickly! Remove patties from heat and let rest for about five minutes.
866,190,11,"While the ""sausage"" is resting, brush the insides of each bun with the remaining tablespoon or so of olive oil. Grill buns on warming rack until they are a lovely golden brown. Remove peppers from bowl and put on platter. Remove skin and sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon sea salt."
867,190,12,"Put a bun on each diner's plate. Spread some fennel-onion mustard on the insides of the buns. Top with a ""sausage"" patty and one or two slices of grilled peppers. Serve with an ice cold beer or a glass of lemonade. Enjoy, and dine al fresco if you can!"
868,191,1,"The cooking of the calamari is the most important part of this dish. You must cook it for no more then 2-3 minutes. Just til it's done, a little curled and white.

Bring medium pot of water to a boil and squeeze in lemon. Throw lemon into water along with the rest of the ingredients. Add the calamari and boil til just tender. About 2 minutes. When the calamari is done, remove with a slotted spoon to a large (preferably) glass bowl and immediately squeeze lemon over the hot squid rings."
869,191,2,Now add the rest of your salad ingredients. Do this quickly so the calamari has a chance to really absorb the flavor of each ingredient. Stir well after each addition.
870,191,3,"Cover bowl and refrigerate until ready to serve.

As oil heats, use a wooden spoon or spatula to break up anchovy until it has ""dissolved"" into the oil. Add olives and stir briefly to coat. Add tuna and break up chunks into smaller pieces. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until heated through."
874,192,4,"By now the pasta should be fully cooked. Drain and return to pot. Pour in the tuna and another tablespoon of the good quality olive oil and toss. Taste and adjust seasoning with salt, pepper, and olive oil as necessary. Divide between bowls of arugula and serve immediately. Arugula will wilt a bit -- don't worry, that's what is supposed to happen!"

Set aside."
896,196,5,"Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add the fennel and sliced onion. Sauté, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are tender and beginning to brown. Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally."
897,196,6,"Heat 2 tablespoons butter in a 5 to 6-quart stock pot or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons olive oil. Warm, then add the pasta. Cook stirring frequently until about a third of the pasta is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add the wine, and cook, stirring, until the wine has absorbed, about 2 minutes. Strain the veggie infused water into the pasta. Increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil.

Turn heat on to medium low. When oil is warm, butter has melted and is a lovely golden color and you can smell its fragrance, add cabbage slices to pan in single layer, if possible. Cabbage may splatter if it is still slightly wet. If that happens, turn heat down a bit. Let cabbage cook for about five minutes without disturbing until underside is caramelized. Watch it carefully because you don't want it to burn. It should be a lovely golden color, not blackened. When cabbage has caramelized on one side, carefully turn pieces over and continue to cook. You may have to adjust the heat, if necessary. You don't want the pieces to cook too quickly. Aim for about five minutes per side."
971,206,3,"While cabbage is cooking, add walnuts to a pie pan and place in preheated oven. After about five minutes, check on nuts. If they are starting to smell fragrant and are a beautiful golden color, remove from heat. Otherwise, give them another minute or two to finish toasting. Remove from heat.

Turn heat down to medium-low. Stir butter frequently, spooning butter over sage leaves. Watch carefully, you don't want the sage leaves (or the butter) to burn. After about five minutes, when sage leaves are a slightly darker green and are no longer limp, remove from butter with slotted spoon. They should have a nice crisp texture. If not, return to butter to continue cooking for another minute or two. When sage leaves have crisped, drain on paper-towl lined plate. Continue cooking butter until it is a lovely dark brown color, about another minute or two more. Remove butter from heat."
975,206,7,"When pasta is almost finished cooking and is still a bit al dente (taste it, if you are in doubt), fish pasta out of saucepan with a spider and add pasta to cabbage mixture in skillet. If there is not much liquid in the pan, add a few more ladlefuls of the cooking liquid. Raise heat to medium, and stir pasta and cabbage together so that the cabbage sauce coats the pasta. Cook for another minute or two until pasta is completely cooked and cabbage sauce has slightly thickened. Remove from heat. Taste and add more salt if necessary. Put a generous amount of pasta and cabbage on each plate or in pasta bowls. Add a generous spoonful of brown butter to each serving of pasta and gently mix with tongs. Add a shower of salted walnuts, top with two crispy sage leaves, and shred Parmesan cheese over top of pasta. Spoon a little more brown butter over all."

991,209,2,"Boil water in a medium sauce pan with a good amount of salt. Add cauliflower florets and cook them several minutes until they are tender but not mushy. About 4 minutes should do it. The final texture is really up to you. I generally enjoy my veggies more al dente than the next guy. Once finished, drain the cauliflower through a colander set atop or inside a large heatproof bowl. You'll want to reserve all of your boiling liquid. Set cauliflower florets aside and return liquid to the sauce pan or larger pan to boil your pasta. Add extra water if needed. Return liquid to a boil and cook your pasta shells as directed on the box. Remember, al dente is always best!"
992,209,3,"While the pasta is cooking, set a large skillet over a medium-low flame. Pour in about 2 tablespoons of olive oil, the garlic, and the crushed red pepper. Take care not to burn the red pepper or garlic, and stir everything occasionally until the garlic becomes slightly golden. Next, add the anchovies. Allow them to melt into the oil. This should take 3 to 4 minutes. Feel free to stir a bit to help them along. Once the anchovies have dissolved, add the drained cauliflower florets into the skillet. Toss everything to combine. Lower the flame to the lowest possible setting while your pasta finishes cooking."
993,209,4,"Once the pasta is ready, drain it in a colander, reserving about a 1/2 cup of pasta water. Pour drained pasta into the cauliflower skillet and toss. Add a couple of tablespoons of pasta water and turn the flame back up to medium. Cook a bit longer until the liquid boils away and thickens. Stir in parsley (and breadcrumbs, if using) and toss. Turn off the flame. Season carefully with salt (remember that anchovies are salty already) and liberally with black pepper. Drizzle with good quality olive oil. Lastly, feel free to add additional crushed red pepper if you like. Serve and enjoy!"
994,210,1,"To prepare the pasta dough, combine the flour, eggs and a pinch of salt in a food processor and mix until it just comes together into a dry dough.

1020,213,2,"While the bacon is cooking, prepare the pasta as directed on the package.  You can use any type of pasta, but you want something that will catch some of the bacon in “pockets”.  For this reason, my favorites to use are orecchiette or farfalle pasta, although in this case, I used penne, which also worked just fine."

Cut the lemons in half and juice them. If using a Meyer lemon, you should have about 4 tablespoons juice; if using a regular lemon, add only 2 tablespoons juice. Add about 1 tablespoon olive oil to blender, put cover on, and blend until ingredients are pureed. Drizzle the rest of the oil into the blender with the motor running. Taste and see if it needs salt or pepper. (Vinaigrette will keep for a couple of days in the refrigerator.)"
1029,215,2,"Roast the peppers: Preheat oven to 475 degrees. Line a baking sheet with heavy duty aluminum foil. Place peppers on foil and put baking sheet in the oven. Roast peppers and keep checking on them, turning them occasionally, until all surfaces are blackened. This will take about 10-15 minutes. Remove from oven and place peppers in a bowl.

With the mixer running on low speed, tip one egg at a time into the bowl and allow it to be fully incorporated before adding the next.  Adding the eggs this way emulsifies the water in the whites into the butter and egg yolks, and keeps your cake nicely tender.  After the eggs have both been incorporated, stop the mixer and scrape all around the sides and bottom of the bowl.  Mix again to incorporate everything."
1036,216,4,"Remove the bowl from the mixer and set a sieve over it.  Measure the flour, polenta, baking powder, salt, and baking soda into it.  Sift the dry ingredients into the bowl.  If all the polenta won’t pass through, sift everything else, being sure to push any lumps through with your fingers, then dump the polenta in last.  Add the milk, lemon zest and juice, and thyme.  Mix on low speed just until all ingredients are incorporated."
1037,216,5,"Brush the edges of an 8″ or 9″ cake pan with the melted butter.  Place a circle of parchment in the bottom.  Scrape in the batter – it will be thick, and that’s fine – then level it evenly."

Place a loaf on a cutting board, and using a large serrated knife, slice cookies 3/4 of an inch thick on the diagonal. If the cookie is crumbling, then let it cool a few more minutes. Don't let it rest too long, however, or they could become too hard to slice. Place slices on their sides back on to the baking sheets; place in the still warm oven with the temperature off and the door closed for 30-60 minutes. The longer they stay in the oven, the harder they will become. Remove from oven and cool completely before storing in an air-tight container, preferably a tin, which helps keep them crisp. Stored properly, biscotti will last up to a month."

1066,222,2,"In heavy bottom skillet or pot crisp bacon. (If you want to use just one pot, cook the bacon in the same pot you plan to use for the beans. If you want the cooking process to go quicker, use a skillet for this step and begin cooking the beans simultaneously, according to instructions in step 3). Drain on separate plate and pour off all but 1 Tablespoon of the bacon grease. In the grease, sweat onions for 2-3 minutes until translucent. Drain most of the liquid off the tomatoes and add to skillet, stirring just until slightly softened. Remove from heat and set aside."
1067,222,3,"Meanwhile, add 8 cups (or enough to cover beans by 1 inch) lukewarm water to beans in a large pot along with whole, peeled garlic cloves, thyme, and peppercorns. Bring to a boil, then reduce to simmer and cook for 20-40 minutes. Check frequently, tasting at least 5-6 beans at a time, as they may not all cook evenly. When beans are al dente (I call this “edible, but not soft enough yet”), add tomato and onion mixture, along with bacon, to the bean pot. Return to simmer. When beans are cooked through but still solid (skins not bursting), remove from heat and discard thyme sprigs, garlic cloves, and any peppercorns you can reach. (It’s okay to leave them in if you don’t mind biting down on pepper every now and then--they soften enough in the pot to be edible, but they are still a little spicy). Stir in 3 Tablespoons chopped parsley."

I will say I don't like it cold, I prefer it room temperature. I then at the end throw some fresh basil in. I did that because basil browns quickly and you want that fresh flavor."
1076,223,8,~ I like to serve my pasta salad over a bed of greens. So I had some arugula I put into the bottom of the bowl. Added the pasta salad on top. Then shaved some Parmesan on top. You can use any cheese. Feta is also great. I had some delicious avocados around so I just sliced it on top. This dish is super versatile and easy to make.

1125,232,2,"Grease a baking pan with a little oil and pour the chestnut mixture. Sprinkle the top with rosemary, pinenuts, walnuts and the remaining raisins. Drizzle some extra oil and bake for about 30 minutes. Castagnaccio is ready when the surface cracks."
1126,233,1,"Combine the raspberries and agave nectar in a medium pot. Smash the raspberries with a potato masher or the bottom of a ramekin. Add the lemon zest and juice, water, and Prosecco. Layer the mint leaves and twist them, tearing them a bit, in your fingers and add to the pot along with a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for 3-4 minutes or until the raspberries have completely broken down into a liquid. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature."
1127,233,2,"Whip a egg white until it multiplies a few times in volume and its peaks hold, but still soft and a little droopy."
1128,233,3,"Strain the cooled raspberry syrup through a chinoise or similar sized mesh strainer to remove all the seeds, the zest and the mint. Add the whipped egg white and completely incorporate with a whisk. It's not necessary to be gentle with folding it in since it's not for a non-chemical leavener. The egg white (along with the Prosecco) is there strictly to give the granita a silky texture and to keep it from freezing too solidly. It does the same thing for sorbets and is especially useful when the recipe doesn't call for alcohol."
1129,233,4,"Pour into a baking pan big enough for the liquid to be 1""-2"" deep. Pop it in the freezer for 2 hours. It will be partially frozen at that point, especially around the edges. With a spoon, mix the frozen part with the non-frozen part for a homogenous semi-liquid granita. Put back in the freezer for another 2 - 3 hours, checking every hour."
1130,233,5,"Before serving, place the bowls you will use for it in the freezer for at least 30 minutes. Scoop the Raspberry Italian Ice into the bowls using a spoon or ice cream scooper."
1131,233,6,"Eat, relax, savor."
1132,233,7,"Note: This has a much ""creamier"" texture than a granita, so using a fork to break it up won't have the same result. But It will still have more of the crunchiness of a granita vs the smoothness of a sorbet."
1133,234,1,Have all the ingredients for this recipe prepared and ready to cook before beginning. Bring about 3 quarts of water to a boil and have it ready for the pasta.
1134,234,2,"Cut the asparagus into lengths about 2 inches long. If the stalks are thick, cut them in half or quarter them. Leave the tips in tact. Heat the butter in a large, deep skillet and add the asparagus pieces, salt, and pepper to taste. Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, or until crisp-tender and lightly browned. Transfer the asparagus to a plate and reserve."
1135,234,3,"In the same pan, add the oil and garlic. Cook until lightly browned and remove and discard garlic. Add the tomatoes, parsley, basil, salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring, for about 10 minutes."
1136,234,4,"Meanwhile, add the pasta and salt to the water and, when it returns to a boil, cook for about 7 minutes or until tender. Do not overcook."
1137,234,5,"Just before the pasta is done, turn off the heat under the tomatoes and add the beaten eggs, stirring vigorously so that they blend without curdling. Do not boil the sauce after the eggs are added. (If you are nervous about curdling the eggs, you may temper them in, by stirring a ladleful of the hot tomato sauce into the eggs, then whisking the mixture back into the pan.)"
1138,234,6,Add the asparagus to the tomato sauce and stir to blend.
1139,234,7,"Drain the pasta immediately. Add the tomato sauce and asparagus, and toss with half the cheese. Serve piping hot with the remaining cheese on the side."
1140,235,1,"Cook pasta according to package directions. When fusilli is done, drain in a colander and chill under cold running water. Drain again."
1141,235,2,"In a large bowl, stir together Dijon mustard, red wine vinegar, honey, olive oil, sea salt, and pepper. Add chicken, pears, blue cheese, basil leaves, and fusilli. Toss and serve."
1142,236,1,"In a very large saute pan, saute the garlic and shallots in the olive oil until everything softens up.  Add the oregano, fennel, salt, pepper and crushed red pepper flakes.  Give it all a couple of stirs and then add the wine. Lower the heat while you bring the chicken stock up to a boil in a separate pot."
1143,236,2,"Cook the pasta  in the broth just short of al dente.  Drain, reserving about 2 cups of the broth for finishing the dish"
1144,236,3,"Turn the heat up to high on your saute pan and when everything starts bubbling add the pasta.  While stirring the pasta, add the spinach leaves a handful at a time along with some of the chicken broth.  Keep stirring and alternating spinach and broth until the spinach has wilted.  Depending on how loose you want the dish, you may not need all the broth."
1145,236,4,Stir in the feta and green onions.  Serve immediately.
1146,237,1,"For the eggs, place a cooling rack or steamer insert (I used my tamis) in the bottom of a large pot or deep baking pan, fill with hot water, insert a fry thermometer, and place on stove over medium heat. Bring temperature to 140 to 145 ℉ degrees, then turn the heat to the lowest setting possible and add eggs (still in their shells). They must stay on the rack and not touch the bottom of the pan.  Maintain the temperature within this range, checking frequently and adjusting the flame as needed, and cook the eggs for 40-45 minutes.  We were lucky, our combination of using a large Le Creuset dutch oven, the tamis, and the lowest possible flame on the range kept the temperature just over 140 ℉ with very little babysitting. Test an egg after 40 minutes by cracking into a small bowl, if the white is cooked, the egg is done. If not, try another in 5 minutes. When the eggs are done, use immediately, or let sit on the counter to cool slightly while you pull the rest of the dish together."
1147,237,2,"While the eggs are poaching, place a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the guanciale in a fine slick of olive oil until nicely browned, but before it has rendered all of its fat, you want it to be crispy-chewy. Remove it from the pan with a slotted spoon and reserve. Pour off any excess fat in the pan, then set it aside to use later.  Put a medium sized sauce pan over medium heat and toss in 2 tablespoons of the butter and the minced shallot, cook until soft and translucent.  Add the garlic, rosemary and pimenton, and stir for about 2-3 minutes.  Whisk in the cream and bring to a gentle boil, reduce the heat to low, then whisk in the balance of the butter in chunks until it is fully integrated.  Pour the grated cheese in slowly, whisking all the while until it is fully melted and the mix is smooth.  Mix with an immersion blender until silky smooth, then season to taste with salt and black pepper, remove from heat, cover and reserve."
1148,237,3,"Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling, salted water per the manufacturers instructions for an al-dente texture.  When done, drain well (reserving a cup of cooking water to thin your sauce later in needed), and pour the pasta into the large skillet in which you cooked the guanciale.  Add the cream sauce and guanciale and place over a low-medium heat to warm through, tossing to mix well.  Season to taste with more salt and pepper if desired."
1149,237,4,"To plate, spoon the pasta mix into a heated bowl, break a poached egg in the center, top with parmesan shavings, minced parsley and freshly ground black pepper.  Just before eating, encourage all to stir the egg into the pasta until it melts completely."
1150,238,1,"Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees.  Mix together polenta, flour, and salt in a bowl."
1151,238,2,"Cream butter, sugar, and lemon zest  until pale and fluffy.  Add egg and egg yolk, one at a time, mixing well after each is added.  Mix in vanilla and lemon extracts."
1152,238,3,"Gradually add dry ingredients and mix until combined.  Transfer batter to a pastry bag with a star tip attachment.  [I use Wilton's 1M, Martha suggests Ateco's #825.]"
1153,238,4,"Pipe cookies into 'S' shapes about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide onto parchment lined cookie sheet.  Bake cookies until edges are golden, about 15-18 minutes, rotating sheet about half-way through baking time.  [Martha suggests chilling the dough in the freezer 30 minutes prior to baking.  I tend to skip this step.]"
1154,238,5,Transfer cookies on parchment to cooling rack and let cool for about 10 minutes.
